# Getting Started

linear_algebra.py is a collections of functions but contains nothing that occurs when you run it so should not be run.

To run test_linear_algebra.py you will need to have nose installed in the directory with test_linear_algebra and linear_algebra.  Once nose is installed enter $ nosetests to run the test suite.  Currently the test for matrix_matrix_multiply does not pass.

## Description

linear_algebra.py contains a number of mathematical functions used for dealing with vectors and functions.

test_linear_algebra.py contains a number of tests to ensure the functions in linear_algebra.py do what they're supposed to.  For info on running the tests see getting started.
